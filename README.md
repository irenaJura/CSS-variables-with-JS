# CSS-variables-with-JS
Simple practice on an image with spacing, blur and base CSS variables.

I created 3 CSS variables on the root element (html tag) with default values.

The variables were added to the image element as padding (spacing), background(base color) and filter (blur).

I used a custom data- attibute on each input element that required a pixel suffix.

Each input was assigned an event listener (change and mousemove) with a forEach method.

Finally, my handleUpdate function sets a new value for a CSS variable that gets changed by using setProperty method.
